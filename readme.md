# Go-Artemis #

Go-artemis is a port of the [artemis](http://www.gamadu.com/artemis/index.html) entity framework.

It is a quite straightforward porting of the original Java code, with some change necessary to accomodate the Go language.

The goal was to learn how things worked in Artemis, and a bit of Go in the mean time. The long-term goal is to come up with an entity system closer to the idioms of Go.

Enough with the dreams, for now here it is, a mostly-untested, probably-memory-leaking, possibly uber-non-optimized, almost-undocumented Artemis port.

Go-get it the usual way, if you want to play with it.
Just be warned: I am not fluent in Go - and quite now to the entity system model.
